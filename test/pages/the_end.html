        <p>This is the end, beautiful friend<br>
            This is the end, my only friend<br>
            The end of our elaborate plans<br>
            The end of everything that stands<br>
            <br>
            The end<br>
            No safety or surprise<br>
            The end<br>
            I'll never look into your eyes again<br>
            <br>
            Can you picture what will be?<br>
            So limitless and free<br>
            Desperately in need of some stranger's hand<br>
            In a desperate land<br>
            <br>
            Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain<br>
            And all the children are insane<br>
            All the children are insane<br>
            Waiting for the summer rain<br>
            <br>
            There's danger on the edge of town<br>
            Ride the king's highway<br>
            Weird scenes inside the gold mine<br>
            Ride the highway West, baby<br>
            <br>
            Ride the snake<br>
            Ride the snake<br>
            To the lake<br>
            The ancient lake, baby<br>
            <br>
            The snake is long<br>
            Seven miles<br>
            Ride the snake<br>
            He's old<br>
            And his skin is cold<br>
            <br>
            The West is the best<br>
            The West is the best<br>
            Get here and we'll do the rest<br>
            The blue bus is calling us<br>
            The blue bus is calling us<br>
            Driver, where are you taking us?<br>
            <br>
            The killer awoke before dawn<br>
            He put his boots on<br>
            He took a face from the ancient gallery<br>
            And he walked on down the hall<br>
            <br>
            He went into the room where his sister lived<br>
            And then he paid a visit to his brother<br>
            And then he, he walked on down the hallway<br>
            And he came to a door<br>
            And he looked inside<br>
            <br>
            "Father?"<br>
            "Yes, son?"<br>
            "I want to kill you"<br>
            "Mother, I want to..."<br>
            Come on, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Come on, baby, take a chance with us<br>
            Come on, baby, take a chance with us<br>
            Come on, baby, take a chance with us<br>
            And meet me at the back of the blue bus<br>
            Doin' a blue rock on a blue bus<br>
            Doin' a blue rock, c'mon yeah!<br>
            <br>
            Fuck, fuck-ah, yeah<br>
            Fuck, fuck<br>
            Fuck, fuck<br>
            Fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah<br>
            C'mon baby, c'mon<br>
            Fuck me baby, fuck yeah<br>
            <br>
            Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, yeah!<br>
            Fuck, yeah! C'mon baby<br>
            Fuck me baby, fuck, fuck yeah<br>
            Whoa, whoa, yeah, fuck, yeah<br>
            C'mon, yeah<br>
            Alright<br>
            <br>
            Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...<br>
            <br>
            This is the end, beautiful friend<br>
            This is the end, my only friend<br>
            The end<br>
            <br>
            It hurts to set you free<br>
            But you'll never follow me<br>
            The end of laughter and soft lies<br>
            The end of nights we tried to die<br>
            <br>
            This is the end</p>
