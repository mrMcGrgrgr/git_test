This is about to get really, really cool.

Also, Hi mom!

I don't know what I will or won't end up doing with this file, but in the meantime,
I will update it daily to get consistent practice with using git and git hub.

So, if it's a .txt file I can use nano to update it an never leave the CLI. I 
can get enough of this. I'm so happy I found computers. This is awesome. You 
want tacos.

I am only altering these documents so I can practice using nano, the shell, and git.
